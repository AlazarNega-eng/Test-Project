## ü§ñ AI Usage

- **AI was used for:**
  - Generating and refactoring code for best practices
  - Creating and updating tests
  - Improving UI/UX with Emotion and transitions
  - Writing and formatting this README
- **Testing:** AI-generated tests and manual test cases were used to verify all features.

## üß™ Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Located in `src/App.test.js` and backend `index.test.js`
- **Component Test:** Uses [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  npm test
  # or for backend
  cd backend && npm test
  ```
- **Sample Test (frontend):**
  ```js
  test("renders project title", () => {
    render(<App />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/Music Library/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```
